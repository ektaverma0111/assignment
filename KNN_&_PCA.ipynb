        "\n",
        "Answer:- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is considered a non-parametric and instance-based learning method because it does not assume any underlying probability distribution for the data and does not build an explicit model during training. Instead, it stores all training data and makes predictions only when a new instance needs to be classified or predicted.\n",

        "\n",
        "The curse of dimensionality refers to the set of problems that arise when the number of features (dimensions) in a dataset becomes very large. As dimensionality increases, the data becomes sparse, and many algorithms (including KNN) face performance issues because distance metrics become less meaningful in high-dimensional space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why It Happens\n",
        "\n",
        "In low dimensions, data points are relatively dense and distances between points are meaningful.\n",
