REST was introduced by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000 and has since become a standard way to design networked applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "A RESTful API is a widely used architectural style for building web services that are easy to use, scalable, and stateless. It leverages standard HTTP methods and resource-based URIs to allow systems to communicate over the web in a flexible and efficient way."

These can be added using third-party libraries as needed.\n",

        "\n",
        "API Keys: Simple tokens provided to clients.\n",

        "HTTP Basic Authentication: Username and password with every request (usually over HTTPS).\n",

        "Key Significances of Flask-RESTful:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Simplifies API Development\n",
        "\n",
        "It offers convenient classes and decorators that make defining RESTful resources and endpoints cleaner and more structured.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Resource-Based Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask-RESTful encourages designing APIs around resources by letting you define resource classes with methods corresponding to HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Request Parsing and Validation\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans =  In Flask, the session object provides a way to store information specific to a user’s session across multiple requests. It is used to keep user-related data between requests in a secure and convenient manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "The session object in Flask plays a crucial role in maintaining user-specific data securely between requests, enabling stateful interactions in web applications despite the stateless nature of HTTP. It is fundamental for implementing features like user authentication and personalized experiences.\n",

        "3. Maintains State in Stateless Protocol\n",
        "\n",
