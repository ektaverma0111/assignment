        "Ans = Generators are a type of iterable in Python, but they are more memory-efficient than regular lists or other iterables. They allow you to create a sequence of values lazily—meaning that the values are generated one at a time as they are needed, rather than all at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are particularly useful when working with large datasets or streams of data where it might not be practical to load everything into memory at once.\n",
        "Key Characteristics of Generators:-\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation:\n",
        "Generators generate values on-the-fly when requested, rather than storing them all in memory. This is known as lazy evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stateful:\n",
        "Generators maintain their state between successive calls, so they don’t need to regenerate the entire sequence. After each yield, they remember where they left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory Efficient:\n",
        "Since generators yield values one at a time, they do not store the entire sequence in memory, making them very memory-efficient for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",

        "Once a generator’s values have been exhausted (i.e., when all values have been yielded), it cannot be reused or restarted.\n",

        "There are two main ways to define a generator in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Using a Generator Function:-A generator function is a function that uses the yield keyword to return values. Each time the yield statement is encountered, the function suspends execution and returns the value. The function can be resumed later, continuing where it left off.\n",

        "# 7 What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "Ans = Advantages of Using Generators Over Regular Functions in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators offer several key benefits compared to regular functions, especially when dealing with large datasets or requiring a memory-efficient approach. Below are the main advantages of using generators:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Memory Efficiency =  Regular functions typically return the entire result (like a list or other collection), meaning the entire sequence is stored in memory at once.  Generators, on the other hand, generate values one at a time as they are requested, using lazy. evaluation. This means that only one item is stored in memory at any given time, making them far more memory-efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Lazy Evaluation = Generators are evaluated lazily, meaning values are generated only when needed. This is especially helpful when working with large data sets, where you may not need all the values at once. Regular functions with return statements or list comprehensions evaluate and generate all results at once, even if you may only need a portion of the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Performance = Generators can provide better performance when working with large datasets because they produce values only when required, avoiding the overhead of constructing large data structures.\n",
        "Regular functions that return lists or other large collections may have additional overhead of creating and storing that collection in memory, even if you only need a small part of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Support for Infinite Sequences = Generators can handle infinite sequences. Since they only generate one value at a time, they can produce an infinite number of values without running out of memory.\n",
        "Regular functions would be unable to return an infinite collection because they would try to generate and store the entire sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. State Retention Between Calls\n",
        "Generators maintain their internal state between calls. Every time the yield statement is encountered, the function’s execution is paused, and it can be resumed later from where it left off. This allows for more flexible control flow and makes generators particularly useful in certain algorithms, such as traversal algorithms or pipelines.\n",
        "Regular functions do not retain state between calls. If you want to preserve the state, you’d typically need to pass data explicitly or use global variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Cleaner and More Readable Code\n",
        "Generators provide a more concise way to write code that deals with large sequences or complex iteration patterns.\n",
        "Without the need to create and manage large intermediate collections (like lists), the code is simpler and more focused on the task of generating and processing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Improved Control Over Iteration\n",
        "Generators give you more control over the iteration process, allowing you to decide when to stop the iteration, pause, or resume.\n",
        "This is beneficial for scenarios like processing large files or dealing with streams of data, where you might want to stop or pause the iteration based on conditions"
