    "#21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans = The __del__ method in Python is a special method known as a destructor. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed, i.e., when the object is about to be garbage collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of __del__:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cleanup Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of __del__ is to perform final cleanup tasks before the object is destroyed, such as releasing external resources like files, network connections, or database connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Automatic Invocation\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythonâ€™s garbage collector automatically calls __del__ when an objectâ€™s reference count drops to zero (no references remain to the object).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Not Guaranteed to be Called Immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike some other languages (e.g., C++ destructors), __del__ is not guaranteed to be called immediately when an object goes out of scope, due to Pythonâ€™s garbage collection strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, __del__ may never be called (e.g., circular references or program termination).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Avoid Complex Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Itâ€™s recommended to keep __del__ simple because complex operations or exceptions in __del__ can cause unpredictable behavior during object destruction."

    "#22 =What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans= Both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods inside a class that are not typical instance methods, but they differ in how they relate to the class and its instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. @staticmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "A static method is a method that does not receive an implicit first argument (neither self nor cls). It behaves like a regular function, but it resides inside the classâ€™s namespace for organizational purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cannot access or modify instance (self) or class (cls) state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defined with the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for utility functions that have some logical connection to the class but donâ€™t need to access class or instance data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Purpose:\n",
    "A helper function inside a class that operates on parameters but is independent of class or instance data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. @classmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "A class method is a method that receives the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named cls. It can access or modify class state that applies across all instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics:\n",

    "The first parameter is cls, referring to the class, not the instance.\n",
    "\n",

    "#23 = How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans = Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes related by inheritance to be treated as objects of a common superclass, but with their own distinct behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanism of Polymorphism with Inheritance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance Provides a Common Interface:-\n",
    "When a subclass inherits from a superclass, it inherits the methods and attributes of that superclass.\n",
    "Multiple subclasses can inherit the same superclass, creating a family of related classes sharing a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Method Overriding Enables Different Behaviors:-\n",
    "Subclasses can override methods of the superclass to provide specific implementations.When a method is called on an object, the version of the method that corresponds to the actual object's class (not the reference type) is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dynamic Method Dispatch (Runtime Polymorphism):-\n",
    "Python determines which method to invoke at runtime based on the actual type of the object.This dynamic lookup enables different behaviors for the same method call on different object types.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Subtype Polymorphism:- Objects of subclasses can be used anywhere the superclass object is expected, thanks to the shared interface.\n",
    "This supports the Liskov Substitution Principle: subclasses can substitute their superclass without affecting correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows one interface to represent different underlying data types through inheritance.Subclass objects can be used interchangeably with superclass references, but their own overridden methods are called.\n",
    "Method calls are resolved at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior.It promotes flexible and extensible code that can work with new subclasses without modification.\n",

    "#24 = What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans = Method chaining is a technique in Object-Oriented Programming where multiple method calls are linked together in a single statement, one after another. Each method call returns an object (usually self), allowing the next method to be called on that returned object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method chaining allows invoking several methods sequentially on the same object, improving code readability and fluency.It relies on methods returning the object itself (self), so that the next method can be called on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method performs its action and then returns self, the current instance.\n",
    "This returned instance can immediately be used to call another method.\n",
    "This creates a chain of method calls on the same object in a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose and Advantages:\n",
    "Cleaner and more concise code by reducing repetitive calls to the same object.\n",
    "Facilitates a fluent interface style, making code easier to read and write.\n",
    "Encourages a more declarative style, showing a sequence of operations as a pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method chaining is calling multiple methods on the same object in one continuous expression.Achieved by methods returning self after execution.\n",

    "#25 = What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans = The __call__ method is a special (dunder) method in Python that allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define the __call__ method inside a class, you make its instances callable.Calling an instance like a function (instance()) triggers the execution of the __call__ method on that instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose and Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Function-like Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows objects to behave like functions, combining data (attributes) and behavior (call logic) in one entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cleaner and More Intuitive Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Using instance() instead of instance.method() can make the code more readable, especially when the object represents some action or operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stateful Callables\n",
    "\n",
    "Enables creating stateful functions that maintain internal state or configuration, which is harder to achieve with regular functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Flexible APIs and Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Used in advanced designs like decorators, callbacks, or functors (function objects) for flexible and expressive code.\n",
